## Introduction
Hello! I'm a NYU music business and data science undergrad. I enjoy working on coding projects that explore music metadata and create innovative solutions to industry challenges.

## Projects
Spotify Parser Playlist Algorithm: Custom playlisting algorithm using Spotify's public API ('Spotipy') to aid A&R and marketing teams at a music label. The algorithm prompts the user to input specific parameters such as genre, mood, artist name, popularity score, or monthly listeners. It then parses through Spotify playlists and filters playlists that meet the input criteria. The algorithm further examines playlist bios to extract those that contain the curator's contact information, such as email or Instagram to easily contact the playlist curators about artist collabs.
Spotify New Artist Finder: Python-based tool using Spotify's API to collect metadata and identify a wide range of new artists to add to a dataset
Spotify Metadata Projects: Utilized Spotify's API and data to analyze music industry trends and user behavior

## Technologies and Skills
Programming Languages: Python, Java, MATLAB, SQL
Libraries and Tools: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Git, Spotify's public API ('Spotipy')
Data Analysis: Microsoft Excel and Office Suite
Music Industry Knowledge: Strong understanding of music industry trends and business practices
Analytical and Problem-Solving Skills: Proficient in using data to solve complex problems

## NYU Classes
Data Structures and Algorithms: A collection of projects that implement various data structures and algorithms, including linked lists, sorting algorithms, and graph traversal algorithms
